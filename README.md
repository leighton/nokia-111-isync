Nokia 111 iSync Plugin
======================

Contact synchronisation for Nokia 111 using iSync and Address Book on Mac OS X. To my knowledge,
iSync is no longer shipped with OS X (since Snow Leopard) so check if you have iSync before buying
a Nokia 111.

To install, place nokia111.phoneplugin in

```
/Applications/iSync.app/Contents/PlugIns/ApplePhoneConduit.syncdevice/Contents/PlugIns
```

To configure and modify, simply open `nokia111.ppdoc`
